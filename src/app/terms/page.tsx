              is a specialized, solo-operated freelancer. To maintain code integrity and project speed,
              I work exclusively within my own established processes, design flows, and tech stack
              (Next.js/Vercel). I work hand in hand with the client but I do not collaborate with
              outside developers or &ldquo;hand-off&rdquo; incomplete code to third parties during
              the build phase.

              initial build only. Advanced custom features (e.g., complex databases, member portals,
              or custom API integrations) are considered an &ldquo;advanced premium site&rdquo;
              which costs extra.

              To ensure ongoing security and high-performance hosting, all projects require enrollment

              a critical security vulnerability before hand-off.
